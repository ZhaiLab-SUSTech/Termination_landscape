# Termination_landscape

Landscape of Transcription Termination in Arabidopsis Revealed by Single-molecule Nascent RNA Sequencing

## Pipeline

- The pipeline developed for processing FLEP-seq data is available at [FLEPSeq](https://github.com/ZhaiLab-SUSTech/FLEPSeq)
- All scripts used for termination landscape analysis in this study is avaliable at [termination_landscape_pipeline](./termination_landscape_pipeline). The pipeline should be run with `snakemake`.

## Data availability

The accession numbers for the FLEP-seq sequencing data presented in this paper are NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA): PRJNA591665 and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE178980.
