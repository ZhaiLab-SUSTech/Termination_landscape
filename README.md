# Landscape of Transcription Termination in Arabidopsis Revealed by Single-molecule Nascent RNA Sequencing

This repository includes all bioinformatics analysis codes used in the manuscript.

## Pipelines

- The pipeline developed for pre-processing FLEP-seq data is available at [FLEPSeq](https://github.com/ZhaiLab-SUSTech/FLEPSeq)
- All codes used for analysis in this study is avaliable at [pipelines](./pipelines). The pipeline should be run with `snakemake`.

## Data availability

The accession numbers for the FLEP-seq sequencing data presented in this paper are NCBIâ€™s Sequence Read Archive (SRA): PRJNA591665 and [Genome Sequence Archive in National Genomics Data Center](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/): CRA005016 and CRA005017.

The FLEP-seq data are also displayed in a [JBrowse](https://zhailab-sustech.github.io/jbrowse2/).
